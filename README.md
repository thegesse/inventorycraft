# Forge clicker game project

## About
### This was supposed to be a simple clicker game for school during our Javascript module, but I decided I wanted to add more so I did it with Javascript and Java, hope you enjoy the game.
### Disclaimer I did not do the styling of the website it was done with ai as I was more interested in doing the javascript and the back end.
### This site will not be hosted or put online, so I will provide instructions for running it.
